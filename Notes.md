# how internet works :smiley:

## TCP/IP

- **The Internet Protocol (IP)** is responsible for addressing and routing data packets across the internet. Every device connected to the internet, such as your computer or smartphone, is assigned a unique identifier called an IP address. It's similar to a phone number, but for computers. IP addresses are written as a series of numbers separated by periods, like 192.168.0.1.


### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):

- **The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** works on top of the IP protocol and focuses on the reliable delivery of data. Unlike IP, TCP ensures that the data arrives at its destination intact, in the correct order, and without any errors.

## Anatomy of URL
- Uniform resource locator

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
- `HTTP` is used for communication between web browsers (like Device A) and web servers (like   B).
### HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):
- Similar to HTTP, but with an added layer of security.
- `HTTPS` is commonly used for secure communication, such as when transmitting sensitive data like passwords or financial information.

### SSH (Secure Shell):

- `SSH` is commonly used for secure remote access, remote command execution, and file transfers.

### FTP (File Transfer Protocol):

- Device A initiates an FTP transfer to Device B, typically for uploading or downloading files.
- FTP allows for efficient file transfers between devices, including servers and clients.


# github

## local repository and remote repository

- `git add remote origin <your ssh link repository>` : connect a remote repo to local 
- `git branch -M main` : renames your master branch to main branch , its for renaming branches
- `git push -u origin main ` pushing the local repo files to your remote repo in main branch 
- `git pull origin main` : geting data from remote repo to your local repo
- `git clone <ssh link repo> `: it copys the whole remote repo to your computer (downloads)
